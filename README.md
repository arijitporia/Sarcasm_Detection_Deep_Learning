# Sarcasm_Detection_Deep_Learning

The aim of a convolution network is to reduce frequency variation through convolutional filters and 
extracting discriminating word sequences as a composite feature map for the LSTM layer.
RNN has demonstrated the power of semantic modelling
quite efficiently by incorporating feedback cycles
in the network architecture. RNN networks include a temporal memory component, which allows
the model to store the temporal contextual information
directly in the model.

CNN-LSTM-DNN is the baseline model for sarcasm detection. SENTIMENT, EMOTION and PERSONALITY are the pre trained feature extraction models.
After extraction of all features we concat them with baseline features and then use the SVM to classify the sarcasic comments.
